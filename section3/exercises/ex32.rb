# way Ruby for-loops are written

# A fruit of type: apples
# A fruit of type: oranges
# A fruit of type: pears
# A fruit of type: apricots

# note this is yet another style, exactly like above
# but a different syntax (way to write it).
change.each {|i| puts "I got #{i}" }

# I got 1
# I got pennies
# I got 2
# I got dimes
# I got 3
# I got quarters


# we can also build lists, first start with an empty one
elements = []

# then use the range operator to do 0 to 5 counts
(0..5).each do |i|
  puts "adding #{i} to the list."
  # pushes the i variable on the *end* of the list

end

# adding 0 to the list.
# adding 1 to the list.
# adding 2 to the list.
# adding 3 to the list.
# adding 4 to the list.
# adding 5 to the list.


# now we can print them out too
elements.each {|i| puts "Element was: #{i}" }

# Element was: 0
# Element was: 1
# Element was: 2
# Element was: 3
# Element was: 4
# Element was: 5
