## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
- It reinforced my existing idea of and reinvigorated the idea that the learning process is never ending. There is no finish line, and the more you understand, manage, and appreciate that fewer frustrations, anxieties, and confusion appear.
- I do my best to reject cynicism and complacency, and try to always maintain an open mind and enthusiasm to learn new skills. If you have a good attitude, a strong work ethic, and you're intellectually curious...the sky is the limit!
- I would add to the list the importance of humility and kindness. It's more or less implied in certain areas, but I would specifically carve it out and spotlight these traits contributing to the habits list of super leaners.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

```ruby
 puts "Hello World!"
```

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

 `#`

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
- An `integer` is a whole number. a `float` is number with a decimal point

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

```ruby
 animal = "zebra"
```

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

```ruby
 p animal
```

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
- Interpolation is combining several different data types into the same line of code without having to convert them all to the same data type.
```ruby
 puts "The most striped mammal is a #{animal}."
```

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
- The `gets` method

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
- `.length` = calculates the total number of characters - including spaces - within a string
- `.split` = "splits" up a string by the spaces and gives you back an array
